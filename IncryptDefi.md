welcome to Incrypt Defi: AI Intelligent DeFi. We're the mobile app that turns complex Solana DeFi yield farming into simple, high-yield strategies—right in your pocket. Built for the Solana Mobile Hackathon, we're making DeFi accessible on devices like the Solana Seeker. Check out our APK download, website, GitHub, X account, and email in the links below. Let's dive in and hack the yields!"
Slide 2 (Problem – 30s)
"The problem? DeFi yield farming on Solana is a cyberpunk nightmare—complex and intimidating. Users juggle multiple protocols, endless risk assessments, and fragmented strategies across clunky apps. The impact is huge: 65-70% of DeFi users abandon strategies due to this complexity, missing billions in yields. And while mobile users spend over 7 hours a day on screens, few DeFi apps are fully mobile-optimized—mobile wallet usage is only around 58%. Data from CoinGecko and DexScreener backs this up. Look at this illustration of digital chaos—it's time for a mobile revolution."
Slide 3 (Solution – 30s)
"That's where Incrypt comes in as your all-in-one mobile DeFi hub on Solana. We integrate Meteora for liquidity farming, Kamino and MarginFi for lending, and our powerhouse IncryptAI for effortless strategy building. Get seamless access to pools and lending with real-time APRs and risks. Chat with IncryptAI in natural language—like 'Build a SOL-USDC leveraged farm'—and it delivers custom plans. Plus, token safety checks via Rugcheck and DexScreener keep you secure. Here's a screenshot of our sleek onboarding screen—simple, neon, and ready for action."
Slide 4 (Features – 45s, including video)
"Let's break down the features. For liquidity farming, browse, create, or join Meteora's DLMM and DAMM pools with intuitive sliders for ranges and auto-compounding to maximize yields. Dive into DeFi lending: Lend or borrow via Kamino and MarginFi, leverage your LP positions up to 5x, and monitor health factors in real-time to avoid liquidations. And the star? IncryptAI—a chat-based AI for yield optimization, token analysis, and guides, like suggesting the best SOL-USDC strategy with risk warnings. Watch this quick video demo of the UI in action—fluid, touch-friendly, and cyberpunk-cool."
Slide 5 (Technology Stack – 40s)
"Under the hood, Incrypt is built with React Native and Expo for top-tier mobile performance, @solana/web3.js for direct blockchain interactions, and SDKs from Meteora, Kamino, and MarginFi. We handle Solana integrations like DLMM/DAMM pools and lending markets, plus Rugcheck and DexScreener APIs for safety. Key challenges? We nailed real-time data pulls, offline caching with AsyncStorage, and AI powered by OpenAI—fine-tuned and trained specifically for Solana DeFi strategies. But the magic is in the Solana Mobile Stack: Deep Mobile Wallet Adapter integration for seamless wallet selection, transaction signing, session management, deep linking, and biometrics. This ensures secure, native mobile DeFi that's perfect for on-the-go farming. Check out this Solana Mobile graphic—it's why we're built for the Seeker."
Slide 6 (Market – 30s)
"Our market is massive: Targeting over 25 million Solana DeFi users—from degens to yield farmers—who crave mobile convenience. Solana's DeFi TVL is now $8-10 billion plus, with mobile crypto users seeing rapid growth, like 40 million new ones in late 2024 alone, per CoinGecko. There's a huge niche for mobile-optimized yield tools, especially with untapped AI strategies. This graphic shows the exploding market—Incrypt is positioned to capture it."
